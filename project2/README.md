USAGE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 2 is a script that displays a countdown until a concert at the end of March, and then plays one of 4 of the artist's songs at random.
To run, use command prompt or powershell to run the command '[dirpath]\getGretaCountdown.py
The countdown will be displayed in days, hours, and minutes in the CLI
A song will then begin playing, and the CLI will display a prompt to press enter to stop playback

TROUBLESHOOTING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most likely cause of error is failure to install playsound, which can be rectified with 'pip install playsound'
Ensure that the 'audio' directory is downloaded and in the same directory as the script
