USAGE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Project 2 is a script that displays a countdown until a concert at the end of March, and then plays one of 4 of the artist's songs at random.<br>
To run, use command prompt or powershell to run the command '[dirpath]\getGretaCountdown.py<br>
The countdown will be displayed in days, hours, and minutes in the CLI<br>
A song will then begin playing, and the CLI will display a prompt to press enter to stop playback

TROUBLESHOOTING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The most likely cause of error is failure to install playsound, which can be rectified with 'pip install playsound'<br>
Ensure that the 'audio' directory is downloaded and in the same directory as the script
