PROJECT 3 README<br>
Author: Alex van de Wetering<br><br>

ABSTRACT:<br>
My Submission for project 3 uses a combination of webscraping and Flask to<br>
present the user with a list of fish types to choose from, and once a selection<br>
is made a list of available fish packages within the selected category and their<br>
prices is pulled from Aquahuna.com and displayed.<br><br>

USAGE:<br>
All dependencies should be included in the Project 3 folder, so once it is downloaded<br>
run web.py using powershell. Then navigate to localhost:5000 to access the project. <br><br>

TROUBLESHOOTING:<br>
The relative paths that were used for file referenceing will only work correctly if<br>
web.py is called from within the project3 directory. Also confirm that flask is installed<br>
to ensure all dependencies are met.
