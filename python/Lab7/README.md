Lab 7 Script Detailing Pillow

Alex van de Wetering

The repository for this lab includes three files, this README, the script and a source image.

This script requires Pillow and pylibjpeg to function correctly

Pull the folder as a whole down to the local machine, and then access
using command prompt by running [path].\Lab7.py

The script will run in 3 phases, the first two opening an example image
The command line then waits for a response to move to the next example
The last step will save a new .gif to this directory
It will provide command line output since python opens .gifs as still images
The gif can be accessed manually
